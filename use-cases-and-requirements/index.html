    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> A large percentage of the data published on the Web is tabular data, commonly published as
        comma separated values (CSV) files. CSV files may be of a significant size but they can be
        generated and manipulated easily, and there is a significant body of software available to
        handle them. Indeed, popular spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel, iWork’s Number, or
        OpenOffice.org) as well as numerous other applications can produce and consume these files.
        However, although these tools make conversion to CSV easy, it is resisted by some publishers
        because CSV is a much less rich format that can't express important detail that the
        publishers want to express, such as annotations, the meaning of identifier codes etc. </p>
      <p> Existing formats for tabular data are format-oriented and hard to process (e.g. Excel);
        un-extensible (e.g. CSV/TSV); or they assume the use of particular technologies (e.g. SQL
        dumps). None of these formats allow developers to pull in multiple data sets, manipulate,
        visualize and combine them in flexible ways. Other information relevant to these datasets,
        such as access rights and provenance, is not easy to find. CSV is a very useful and simple
        format, but to unlock the data and make it portable to environments other than the one in
        which it was created, there needs to be a means of encoding and associating relevant
        metadata. </p>
      <p> To address these issues, the CSV on the Web Working Group seeks to provide: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Metadata vocabulary for CSV data</li>
        <li>Access methods for CSV Metadata</li>
        <li>Mapping mechanism to transforming CSV into various Formats (e.g., RDF, JSON, or
          XML)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In order to determine the scope of and elicit the requirements for this <i>extended</i>
        CSV format (CSV+) a set of use cases have been compiled. Each use case provides a narrative
        describing how a representative user works with tabular data to achieve their goal,
        supported, where possible, with example datasets. The use cases observe existing common
        practice undertaken when working with tabular data, often illustrating shortcomings or
        limitations of existing formats or technologies. It is anticipated that the additional
        metadata provided within the CSV+ format, when coupled with metadata-aware tools, will
        simplify how users work with tabular data. As a result, the use cases seek to identify where
        user effort may be reduced. </p>
      <p> A set of requirements, used to guide the development of the CSV+ specification, have been
        derived from the compiled use cases. </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Adam Retter)</span>
        </p>
        <p>The laws of England and Wales place obligations upon departments and <a
            href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">The National Archives</a> for the collection,
          disposal and preservation of records. Government departments are obliged within the <a
            href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/legislation/public-records-act.htm"
            >Public Records Act 1958</a> sections 3, 4 and 5 to select, transfer, preserve and make
          available those records that have been defined as public records. These obligations apply
          to records in all formats and media, including paper and digital records. Details
          concerning the selection and transfer of records can be found <a
            href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/our-services/selection-and-transfer.htm"
            >here</a>.</p>
        <p>Departments transferring records to TNA must catalogue or list the selected records
          according to The National Archives' defined cataloguing principles and standards.
          Cataloguing is the process of writing a description, or <em>Transcriptions of Records</em>
          for the records being transferred. Once each Transcription of Records is added to the
          Records Catalogue, records can be subsequently discovered and accessed using the supplied
          descriptions and titles.</p>
        <p>TNA specifies what information should be provided within a Transcriptions of Records and
          how that information should be formatted. A number of formats and syntaxes are supported,
          including RDF. However, the predominant format used for the exchange of Transcriptions of
          Records is CSV as the government departments providing the Records lack either the
          technology or resources to provide metadata in the XML and RDF formats preferred by the
          TNA.</p>
        <p>A CSV-encoded Transcriptions of Records typically describes a set of Records, often
          organised within a hierarchy. As a result, it is necessary to describe the
          interrelationships between Records within a single CSV file.</p>
        <p>Each row within a CSV file relates to a particular Record and is allocated a unique
          identifier. This unique identifier behaves as a primary key for the Record within the
          scope of the CSV file and is used when referencing that Record from within other Record
          transcriptions.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Requires:</strong>
          <a href="#R-PrimaryKey">PrimaryKey</a> and <a href="#R-ForeignKeyReferences"
            >ForeignKeyReferences</a>
        </p>

        <p>Upon receipt by TNA, each of the Transcriptions of Records is validated against the (set
          of) centrally published data definition(s); it is essential that received CSV metadata
          comply with these specifications to ensure efficient and error free ingest into the
          Records Catalogue.</p>
        <p>The validation applied is dependent the type of entity described in each row. Entity type
          is specified in a specific column (e.g. <code>type</code>).</p>
        <p>The data definition file, or CSV Schema, used by the CSV Validation Tool effectively
          forms the basis of a formal contract between TNA and supplying organisations. For more
          information on the CSV Validation Tool and CSV Schema developed by TNA please refer to the
            <a href="https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator#csv-validator">online
            documentation</a>. </p>
        <p>The CSV Validation Tool is written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>

            href="#R-CsvValidation">CsvValidation</a>
        </p>

        <p>Following validation, the CSV-encoded Transcriptions of Records are transformed into RDF
          for insertion into the triple store that underpins the Records Catalogue. The CSV files do
          not include all the information required to undertake the transformation, e.g. defining
          which RDF properties are to be used when creating triples for the data value in each cell.
          As a result, bespoke software has been created by TNA to supply the necessary additional
          information during the CSV to RDF transformation process. The availability of generic
          mechanisms to transform CSV to RDF would reduce the burden of effort within TNA when
          working with CSV files.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) is the UK’s
          largest independent producer of official statistics and is the recognised national
          statistical institute for the UK. It is responsible for collecting and publishing
          statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local
          levels.</p>
        <p>Sets of statistics are typically grouped together into collections of tabular data for

        <p>In each of the examples above, multiple data tables are provided in a single Microsoft
          Excel Workbook, one table per sheet. Each Workbook includes a manifest of the tables
          included therein - provided as a table of contents. Furthermore, each Workbook also
          provides metadata pertaining to the whole package. For example, the <a
            href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ppi2/producer-prices-indices/december-2013/rft-mm22-producer-price-indices--reference-table--december-2013.xls"

            >labour market statistics</a> sheet 18(1). Here we see statistics relating to headline
          estimates, change on quarter and change on year. A closer inspection indicates that the
          column layout is identical for each sub-table; only the meaning of the data values
          changes.</p>

        <h2>Use Case #3 - Creation of consolidated global land surface temperature climate
          databank</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Jeremy Tandy)</span>
        </p>
        <p> Climate change and global warming have become one of the most pressing environmental
          concerns in society today. Crucial to predicting future change is an understanding of how
          the world’s historical climate, with long duration instrumental records of climate being
          central to that goal. Whilst there is an abundance of data recording the climate at
          locations the world over, the scrutiny under which climate science is put means that much
          of this data remains unused leading to a paucity of data in some regions with which to
          verify our understanding of climate change.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.surfacetemperatures.org/home">International Surface Temperature
            Initiative</a> seeks to create a consolidated global land surface temperatures databank
          as an open and freely available resource to climate scientists.</p>

        <p>To achieve this goal, climate datasets, known as “decks”, are gathered from participating
          organisations and merged into a combined dataset using a scientifically peer reviewed <a
            href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage3/merging_methodology.pdf"
            > method</a> which assesses the data records for inclusion against a variety of
          criteria.</p>

        <p>Given the need for openness and transparency in creating the databank, it is essential
          that the provenance of the source data is clear. Original source data, particularly for
          records captured prior to the mid-twentieth century, may be in hard-copy form. In order to
          incorporate the widest possible scope of source data, the International Surface
          Temperature Initiative is supported by <a
            href="http://www.surfacetemperatures.org/databank/data-rescue-task-team">data rescue
            activities</a> to digitise hard copy records.</p>

        <p>The data is, where possible, published in the following four stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stage 0: raw digital image of hard copy records or information as to hard copy
            location</li>

        <p>The Stage 1 data is typically provided in tabular form - the most common variant is
          white-space delimited ASCII files. Each data deck comprises multiple files which are
          packaged as a compressed tar ball (<code>.tar.gz</code>). Included within the compressed
          tar ball package, and provided alongside, is a read-me file providing unstructured
          supplementary information. Summary information is often embedded at the top of each
          file.</p>

        <p>For example, see the <a
            href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/globaldatabank/monthly/stage1/uganda/uganda.monthly.stage1.20120301.tar.gz"

        <p>The Ugandan Stage 1 data deck appears to be comprised of two discrete datasets, each
          partitioned into a sub-directory within the tar ball: <code>uganda-raw</code> and
            <code>uganda-bestguess</code>. Each sub-directory includes a Microsoft Word document
          providing supplementary information about the provenance of the dataset; of particular
          note is that <code>uganda-raw</code> is collated from 9 source datasets whilst
            <code>uganda-bestguess</code> provides what is considered by the data publisher to be
          the best set of values with duplicate values discarded.</p>

        <p>At present, the global surface temperature databank comprises 25 Stage 1 data decks for
          monthly temperature observations. These are provided by numerous organisations in
          heterogeneous forms. In order to merge these data decks into a single combined dataset,
          each data deck has to be converted into a standard form. Columns consist of: <code>station
            name</code>, <code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code>, <code>altitude</code>,
            <code>date</code>, <code>maximum monthly temperature</code>, <code>minimum monthly
            temperature</code>, <code>mean monthly temperature</code> plus additional provenance

        <p>Because of the heterogeneity of the Stage 1 data decks, bespoke data processing programs
          were required for each data deck consuming valuable effort and resource in simple data
          pre-processing. If the semantics, structure and other supplementary metadata pertinent to
          the Stage 1 data decks had been machine readable, then this data homogenisation stage
          could have been avoided altogether. Data provenance is crucial to this initiative,
          therefore it would be beneficial to be able to associate the supplementary metadata
          without needing to edit the original data files.</p>

        <p>The resulting merged dataset provides time series of how the observed climate has changed 
          over a long duration at approximately 32000 locations around the globe. Such instrumental
          climate records provide a basis for climate research. However, it is well known that these
          climate records are usually affected by inhomogeneities (artifical shifts) due to changes
          in the measurement conditions (e.g. relocation, modification or recalibration
          of the instrument etc.). As these artificial shifts often have the same magnitude as the
          climate signal, such as long-term variations, trends or cycles, a direct analysis of the
          raw time-series data can lead to wrong conclusions about climate change.</p>
        <p>Statistical homogenisation procedures are used to detect and correct these artificial shifts. 
          Once detected, the raw time-series data is annotated to indicate the presence of artifical
          shifts in the data, details of the homogenisation procedure undertaken and, where possible, 
          the reasons for those shifts.</p>

	<h2>Use Case #8 - Reliability Analyses of Police Open Data</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by Davide Ceolin)</span>
        </p>
	<p>Several Web sources expose datasets about UK crime statistics.
	These datasets vary in format (e.g. maps vs. CSV files), timeliness, aggregation level, etc.
	Before being published on the Web, these data are processed to preserve the privacy of the people
	involved, but again the processing policy varies from source to source.</p>
	<p>Every month, the UK Police Home Office publishes (via data.police.uk) CSV files that report crime
	counts, aggregated on geographical basis (per address or police neighbourhood) and on type basis.
	Before publishing, data are smoothed, that is, grouped in predefined areas and assigned to the
	mid point of each area. Each area has to contain a minimum number of physical addresses. The goal
	of this procedure is to prevent the reconstruction of the identity of the people involved in the
	crimes.</p>
	<p>Over time, the policies adopted for preprocessing these data have changed, but data previously
	published have not been recomputed. Therefore, datasets about different months present relevant
	differences in terms of crime types reported and geographical aggregation (e.g. initially, each
	geographical area for aggregation had to include at least 12 physical addresses. Later, this
	limit was lowered to 8).</p>
	<p>These policies introduce a controlled error in the data for privacy reasons, but these changes
	in the policies imply the fact that different datasets adhere differently to the real data, i.e.
	they present different reliability levels. Previous work [1] provided two procedures for measuring
	and comparing the reliability of the datasets, but in order to automate and improve these procedures,
	it is crucial to understand the meaning of the columns, the relationships between columns, and how the
	data rows have been computed.</p>
	<p>For instance, here is a snippet from a dataset about crime happened in Hampshire in April 2012:
	<pre class="example">

	Also, it is important to understand the precise semantics of each column.
	This is relevant for two reasons. First, to identify relations between columns (e.g. some crime types
	are siblings, while other are less semantically related). Second, to identify semantic relations between
	columns in heterogeneous datasets (e.g. a column in one dataset may correspond to the sum of two or more
	columns in others).

              <p>To express semantics in a machine readable form, RDF seems the appropriate choice.
                Furthermore, best practice indicates that one should adopt common and widely adopted
                patterns (e.g. RDF vocabularies, OWL ontologies) when publishing data to enable a
                wide audience to consume and understand the data. Existing (de facto) standard
                patterns may add complexity when defining the semantics associated with a particular
                row such that a single RDF predicate is insufficient. </p>
              <p>For example, to express a quantity value using <a href="http://qudt.org/">QUDT</a>
                we use an instance of <code>qudt:QuantityValue</code> to relate the numerical value
                with the quantity kind (e.g. air temperature) and unit of measurement (e.g.
                Celsius). Thus the semantics needed for a column containing temperature values might
                be: <code>qudt:value/qudt:numericValue</code> – more akin to a <a
                  href="http://marmotta.apache.org/ldpath/language.html">LDPath</a>.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, use of OWL axioms when defining a sub-property of
                  <code>qudt:value</code> would allow the quantity type and unit of measurement to
                be inferred, with the column semantics then being specified as
                  <code>ex:temperature_Cel/qudt:numericValue</code>.</p>

              <strong>Ability to declare a "missing value" token and, optionally, a reason for the
                value to be missing</strong>
            </em>
            <p>Significant amounts of existing tabular text data include values such as
                <code>-999</code>. Typically, these are outside the normal expected range of values
              and are meant to infer that the value for that cell is missing. Automated parsing of
              CSV files needs to recognise such missing value tokens and behave accordingly.
              Furthermore, it is often useful for a data publisher to declare <em>why</em> a value
              is missing; e.g. <code>withheld</code> or <code>aboveMeasurementRange</code></p>
